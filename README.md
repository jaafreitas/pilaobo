# Introduction to Pilaobo
Pilaobo is an interactive robot built with a ATtiny85 microcontroller, two servos and one ultrasonic distance sensor and it can be used as base for any other simple robot.

# How it works
When something gets close to it, it moves both arms between 45 to 135 degrees. The robot stops when it cannot detect anything close to it anymore.

# Dependencies
It depends on the DigisparkSoftRcPulseOut library available on Arduino Library Manager.
